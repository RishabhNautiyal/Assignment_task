# Assignment_task
I have solved the programming tests given by Tandemloop Technologies.
For Problem 1, I have used HTML, Javascript with if-else conditons because I was having some issues on class part as I didn't know that yet, but I will work on OOPs concepts further.
For Problem 2 and 3, I have used Javascript and Complier(Code Editor) for testing. To run the code snippets and view the outputs please use the complier.
For Problem 4, I have used HTML,CSS with grid system to make responsive UI.
